Client Websocket Services
=========================

In the Webservice/REST API, two websockets are offered to clients. They are: 

`/jmapdata`
    Request a websocket for real-time map overlay updates with trackers, etc. It is open for all, but login- and authorized users can receive different content. 
    
`/notify`
    Request a websocket for notifications, etc. This is a generic publish/subscribe service. 
    

Websocket for map overlay updates
---------------------------------

This service will provide real-time updates of map-information. Typically APRS points and trails. Clients can send `SUBSCRIBE` commands over the websocket to request updates. When the server receives such a command, it will start sending updates to the client::

    SUBSCRIBE filter, x1, x2, x3, x4, scale [, tag] 

Where the parameters are: 

 * **filter** - name of the filter to be used at the server. Corresponds to the filter menu on the webapp2 client.
 * **x1** - upper limit (north) of the area of interest (degrees latitude -90 to 90).
 * **x2** - right limit (east) of the are of interest (degrees longitude).
 * **x3** - lower limit (souith) of the area of interest (degrees latitude -90 to 90).
 * **x4** - left limit (west) of the area of interest (degrees longitude)
 * **scale** - scale of the map as it is displayed on the screen.
 * **tag** (optional) - limit the selection of tracking-obbjects to items having this tag set.


Update format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updates are sent to client when there is a change within the area of interest. The frequency of updates is limited to max 1 per 10 seconds. Updates are in JSON format. Note that when the connection is made and *before* a `SUBSCRIBE` command is issued, an empty **JsOverlay** object is sent to client (where points, delete, lines and pcloud is null).
