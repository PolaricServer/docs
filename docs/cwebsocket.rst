Client Websocket Services
=========================

In the Webservice/REST API, two websockets are offered to clients. They are: 

`/jmapdata`
    Request a websocket for real-time map overlay updates with trackers, etc. It is open for all, but login- and authorized users can receive different content. 
    
`/notify`
    Request a `websocket for notifications <#id1>`_. This is a generic publish/subscribe service.
    

Websocket for map overlay updates
---------------------------------

This service will provide real-time updates of map-information. Typically APRS points and trails. Clients can send `SUBSCRIBE` commands over the websocket to request updates. When the server receives such a command, it will start sending updates to the client::

    SUBSCRIBE filter, x1, x2, x3, x4, scale [, tag] 

Where the parameters are: 

 * **filter** - name of the filter to be used at the server. Corresponds to the filter menu on the webapp2 client.
 * **x1** - upper limit (north) of the area of interest (degrees latitude -90 to 90).
 * **x2** - right limit (east) of the are of interest (degrees longitude).
 * **x3** - lower limit (souith) of the area of interest (degrees latitude -90 to 90).
 * **x4** - left limit (west) of the area of interest (degrees longitude)
 * **scale** - scale of the map as it is displayed on the screen.
 * **tag** (optional) - limit the selection of tracking-obbjects to items having this tag set.


Update format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updates are sent to client when there is a change within the area of interest. The frequency of updates is limited to max 1 per 10 seconds. Updates are in JSON format. Note that when the connection is made and *before* a `SUBSCRIBE` command is issued, a **JsOverlay** object is sent to client (where points, delete, lines and pcloud is null). It can be used to see the authorizations.

Websocket for notifications
---------------------------

This service will provide various asynchronous messages (events), primarily from servers to clients. Clients can subscribe to different 'rooms' provided by servers. Clients that subscribe to a room get messages posted to that room by the server (or other clients). This is a kind of general publish/subscribe service. Clients can send the following commands to the server over the websocket::

    SUBSCRIBE room
    UNSUBSCRIBE room
    PUT room,data

Where the parameters are: 

 * **room** - name of the room. Rooms can be created by servers. 
 * **data** - data to be sent to subscribers of the room. Can be JSON encoded. 

Rooms offered by aprsd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *aprsd* creates the following rooms. Observe that some of the rooms can be created specific for users or
specific for APRS callsigns. Events without data-content just indicates that change has happened and client 
can the use REST API to get updated information. 

======================== ============== =================================================
Room name                Data content   Purpose
======================== ============== =================================================
messages:<userid>        Message        Short messages - incoming message
msgstatus:<userid>       Status         Short messages - status
auth:<userid>                           Change in user role or authorizations
bullboard                               Change in bulletin board content
sign                                    Change in signs *(db plugin)*
object                                  Change in JSON objects *(db plugin)*
sharing                                 Change in sharings of objects 
telemetry:<callsign>                    Change in telemetry data for a callsign
notify:SYSTEM            Notification   General system notications
notify:ADMIN             Notification   User notification for admin-users
notify:<userid>          Notification   User notification for specific user
======================== ============== =================================================


User notification events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A special type of events are *user-notifications*. They are sent to the client-app which can display them on the screen. A typical way to do this is to show a icon showing the count of active notifications. The user can click to see the list of notifications which indicate systems events, that messages has arrived, etc.. 

User notifications carry a JSON-encoded object with the following fields: 

============ ========= ========================================
 type         String    Notification type
 from         String    Sender of the event (userid or 'admin')
 text         String    Content, short text
 time         Date      Timestamp
 ttl          integer   Time to live (in seconds)
============ ========= ========================================

The type field can be used to identify purposes of events. For example to report errors. *Polaric Webapp2* currently recognizes the following: ``loc``, ``check``, ``chat``, ``mail``, ``system``, ``error``, ``alert`` or ``info`` and uses different icons when displaying those. 


Short messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Logged in users can send messages to each other. Incoming messages can be sent as asynchronous events through the 'message' room. A notification is sent in addition. The message has the following fields: 

============== ============== ===================================================
msgId           integer        Unique message identifier
status          integer        Delivery status: 0=unknkown, 1=success, -1=failure    
time            Date           Timestamp 
from            String         Sender (userid@server or callsign@APRS)
to              String         Recipient 
read            boolean        True if read?
outgoing        boolean        True if outgoing message
text            String         Content
============== ============== ===================================================

The 'msgstatus' room can be used to notify about delivery success or failure. 

======== ========= ==================================================
 msgId    integer   Unique message identifier
 status   integer   Delivery status: 0=unknkown, 1=success, -1=failure  
 info     String    Optional information
======== ========= ==================================================
